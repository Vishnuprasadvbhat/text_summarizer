0,Vicki ,5.0 ,Very worth the price,"
1. Very smooth and soft material. Comfortable and nice fitting on the ears. Not too loose or tight.2. Amazing sound quality. Don’t have to raise the volume halfway in order to hear properly. Raise the volume just one time and the audio is perfect, zero strain on the ears. Though they are noise canceling, they give you just enough volume to not only muffle/decrease any surrounding and distracting noise, but to also give you the ability to hear outside noise just enough that you won’t miss your name being called, etc.3. You can be on your side while wearing them. As someone who preferably likes to lay and sleep on their side, having over the ear headphones usually isn’t comfortable. However, because these headphones aren’t so thick, you can practically be in any position you want.4. If your headphones aren’t connecting, all you need to do is shut off your phone and turn it back on again.

1,AmazonShopper,5.0 ,good for the price,"
these work well. I got them when they were discounted so it was an excellent deal. I wish they worked with the radio on my phones but they don't, but they work with streaming radio. the sound is really good. as noise cancelling headphones they are ok. they don't filter out everything. they are really comfortable. I have a huge head so some headphones aren't super comfy for me, but these are good. kinda wish the on / off buttons were quicker at powering the device on and off. yeah definitely I would buy them again.

2,Dragongravy,4.0 ,great set of headphones for the money,"
pros- great sound, decent bass, holds a charge great, noise canceling is greatcons- could be more durable. the swivel joint is the weak pointi'm on my third pair. first one for me i use daily, no problems. second pair for my wife, used daily and all day some days. its great for someone with sensory issues needing to drown out the world. accidently broke the second pair at the weak point mentioned afore. totally our fault. ordering a third to replace the broken set. dont get me wrong the broken set still works and works pretty well. will save them for a hacking project or parts. only reason this doesnt get 5 stars is the weak point. if they fixed that and used a more durable plastic the price would go up. overall im very satisfied for the value and performance these provide.

3,Mike,5.0 ,The audio is crystal clear and perfect for music lovers!,"
I'm thoroughly impressed with the sound quality of this product! The audio is crystal clear and perfect for music lovers, with deep bass and crisp highs. But what really sets it apart is its excellent performance during phone calls - my partner has even commented on how clear and natural my voice sounds, even in noisy environments. The fact that it's earned the seal of approval from my partner is a testament to its exceptional quality. Whether I'm jamming out to my favorite tunes or catching up with loved ones, this product delivers!

4,TW in New York,5.0 ,Work Great,"
I’ve never owned noise canceling headphones, so I’m not an expert in terms of comparing these to others, but as an uninitiated user, they are pretty amazing. I’m really impressed with how these seem to block out sound. They sound great too when using them to connect to the TV or my phone to listen to music or podcasts. I’m pleased with the quality and value of these - and the blue looks nice!

5,rabar,3.0 ,You get what you pay for!,"
I really like the price of these headphones.  I wanted something with bluetooth that weren't ear buds.  These headphones work alright.  The problem is with connecting to Zoom meetings; I often get a message that they aren't working properly.  This is easy enough (though annoying) to fix, as I just go into the Zoom audio, switch it to the computer's speaker and mic, and then switch both back to the headphones, and then everything works fine.  But I have to do this almost every time I'm on Zoom, and I use it at least twice a day.  As for the noise-cancelling, I don't really use it, but I tried it--it's just a sound of static (white noise), but I don't have experience with other noise-cancelling headphones, so I don't know if they are all like that or not.  Either way, I wasn't impressed, but that's not why I bought them.  The bluetooth starts breaking up if the computer is in the living room and I go into the bedroom (about 25 ft away).  It always breaks up if the microwave is on and I'm in the kitchen, but I guess that's kind of expected with any electronics (reminds me of vacuuming with the TV on back in the day).  The sound is rather good, but I don't listen to music or play video games, so I can't really say whether it would be good for that.  The mic works well, as long as everything is working properly.  The battery lasts for a good while, although when I plug them in to charge, the headphones disconnect from the device and I can't use them while they're charging.  They serve my purpose, but I wouldn't recommend them.  If you can afford to get name-brand, then go for it.

6,Kara C,5.0 ,Buy them!!,"
I am so happy w these headphones I immediately bought a protective case for them. They worked GREAT! Music is loud & clear - I can only go up 75% and like 90% in loud areas when watching TV. Used it for phonecalls super clear loud and the noise canceling did such a good job I almost missed my food delivery the guy was banging on my door and I was 10ft away and couldnt hear him! Plus theyre comfy .. I would buy now you will be happy you did.

7,BLEU,5.0 ,Amazing!,"
These have lasted for almost 4 days now, just being on for music or just not being connected to Bluetooth and still on. The only difference btwn this newest version and the previous version is the amount of ANC options/sound type options. The newest model comes with 3 modes of anc and 0 of type of music modes, the previous came with 5 or 6 types of music modes (which was impressive as they even included a setting for Jazz which is not my type of music but it's often overlooked. I enjoy the ancient on mode, but not the anc 2 mode which amplifies the outside world and lowers your in headphone audio for self-protection mode. The anc on mode makes my ears hurt because it's too quiet. But the anc off mode doesn't answer honestly I don't really hear much of the outside world anyway because the ear cups are fully covering my entire ears and not pressing on them. It's a really great price and really great quality. I wish they still offered the pink color as I know a lot of pink lovers. I am fond of blue and love this shade of blue as it perfectly blends in with my hair.

8,PL@VT,4.0 ,BERIBES Upgraded Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones have great features,"
BERIBES Upgraded Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones have great features and are incredibly comfortable. I bought them for an ""off label"" use in that I wanted to primarily use them Without any Music and just the Noise Cancelling feature as my desk is next to a very loud AC unit by itself....alas, using without music & only the noise cancelling feature still helps but It's gives my ears an uncomfortable feeling (thus the 4 vs 5) which Is explained in Wire Cutter's article about ""ear suck"" that only affects some people <Otherwise, I'd recommend me these as great.

9,Will P.,4.0 ,Pretty decent for a good price,"
When I placed these on my head and got them paired up with my phone. I played some music and was decently surprised. Comfort was good and sound was great. Not heavy on the bass for music but good for listening to the lyrics.Wearing them at work for 3 hours they got a little warm around my ears and had them sit on my shoulders. It was nicely designed so that the ear covers could be turned to face upwards so they were like little speakers sitting on my shoulders.I'd give time two thumbs up for this price range. I'd buy them again too for a friend.
